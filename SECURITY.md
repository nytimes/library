# Security Issues

The New York Times takes security bugs in the NYTimes authored or maintained OSS
seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and
will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email <secbugs@nytimes.com> with bug title as a
subject line and you will get a response indicating the next steps in handing
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask
for additional information or guidance.

If you find vulnerabilities in software, libraries or modules used by NYTimes
authored or maintained OSS but written by third-party, please report the
vulnerability to the person or team maintaining the code.
