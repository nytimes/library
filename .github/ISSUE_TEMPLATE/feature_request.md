Before submitting a feature request, ensure that you can't already implement the feature using any of Library's customization patterns. Custom middleware, cache, styling, and strings are supported. More information about customization options in Library: https://github.com/nytimes/library/blob/master/custom/README.md

If you wish to propose a change, submit an issue describing your idea before beginning development. It's worth making sure that a similar feature is not already in process, or the feature has already been deemed out of scope of the project.
