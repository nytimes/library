If you have a question about how to do something with Library, consider first posting to the
discussion board at https://github.com/nytimes/library/discussions. For more specific cases,
you can open an issue and we will try to point you in the right direction. Before opening one of
these, make sure to consult the demo site which has answers to many common questions: https://nyt-library-demo.herokuapp.com/

You can also submit questions to our Google group: https://groups.google.com/g/nyt-library-community

We also answer questions in the #proj-library channel of the News Nerdery slack: http://newsnerdery.slack.com/

### What I am trying to do
<!-- Describe what you are trying to do with Library and where you are struggling. We'll try to help you find an existing solution, or assist in opening a feature request. -->

### What I have attempted so far
<!-- If you have tried to use any existing functionality of Library to support your use case, mention that here. -->

### What my application logs say (if I am getting a server error)
<!-- Server errors in Library are intended to be public facing, so the application logs are crucial to diagnosing problems from generic errors. -->
