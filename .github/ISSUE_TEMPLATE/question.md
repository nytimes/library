### What I am trying to do
<!-- Describe what you are trying to do with Library and where you are struggling. We'll try to help you find an existing solution, or assist in opening a feature request. -->

### What I have attempted so far
<!-- If you have tried to use any existing functionality of Library to support your use case, mention that here. -->

### What my application logs say (if I am getting a server error)
<!-- Server errors in Library are intended to be public facing, so the application logs are crucial to diagnosing problems from generic errors. -->
